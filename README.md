Virtual faishon try on is a challenging research area with one of the aim to make shopping more easier. With its development a person can be able to virtually try the desired cloths or faishon items sitting at home. How to acheive it with minimal artifacts, is still a question? Upon several research on different approach I found that the predominant approach to the problem is - To use GAN on combination of key pose of the target person wearing fashion garment along with its segmented image and the Refrence Fashion Item. With this Idea, below I have shown the proposed network architecture for this task.
